# Top Security Failures

Top security failures

* exposed services
* unnecessary accounts, excessive permissions
* denial of service
* unpatched, outdated vulnerable services, applications
* weak access controls, exposed credentials
* no backup or disaster recovery plan
* unknown services, applications, and assets running inside the perimeter
* no basic AV, operating systems, firewall protections

## Use Nmap for Discovery of Network Hosts

Nmap can discover, hosts, and services. It can also be used for vulnerability discovery. (https://nmap.org/)

### Nmap Host Discovery Options

nmap -sP  network CIDR
nmap -O network CIDR 
nmap -sV  host or network

### Discover Operating Systems

nmap -sV  host or network

### Discover Running Services

You can specify ports using:
nmap -p21,23,80,445 

### Pro Tips on Port Ranges

* Range: 0-1023 Well known System Ports
  * 21 FTP 
  * 80 HTTP 
  * require root/administrator privileges 
* Range: 1023-49151 User or Registered Ports
  * MySQL 3306 
  * RDP 3389 
* Range: 49151-65535 Dynamic Ports
  * Dynamically allocated and used for specific sessions and connections 

### Timing Templates

Timing Templates determine how quickly and frequently the packets sent to targets are executed. The lower the timing, the longer between scan attempts. You may have heard people refer to a T1 vs. a T3 connection. 
* T0 Paranoid 
* T1 Sneaky 
* T2 Polite 
* T3 Normal 
* T4 Aggressive 
* T5 Insane

## Use Nmap for Vulnerability Discovery

* You can discover vulnerabilities in hosts using Nmap Scanner. 
* Vulnerability discovery should always be made with due care and only under authorization. 
* Nmap can discover and exploit vulnerabilities. 
* Nmap is not a full-featured vulnerability scanner but is a good place to start.

## Nmap Vulnerability Discovery 

* You can discover vulnerabilities by looking at specific services, versions, or application banners. 
* You can also use NSE Scripts. These are special scripts designed to test for specific vulnerabilities. 

## Nmap Script Engine (NSE)

* Allows users to write and share scripts (Written in LUA language) 
* These scripts can automate specific tasks, including 
  * Specific network discovery 
  * Specific services 
  * Testing for vulnerabilities of certain exploits 
* The following operator -sC applies all default scripts
  * Example: Nmap -sC host or CIDR 
* Considered intrusive 
* Should not be run without permission

|Default|series of scripts grouped according to specific criteria and run by default using mmap -Sc host or network CIDR.|
|Discovery|Specific discovery tasks addressing services such as SNMP, or Directory Services, or SMB enumeration.|
|DoS|Scripts that will replicate denial of service attacks.|
|Exploit|Scripts that execute exploits.|
|External|These scripts may send requests to third parties, or other network resources.|
|Fuzzer|Sends server software unexpected or randomized fields in each packet.|
|Intrusive|High-risk script that is likely to crash services.|
|Malware|Tests a platform to see if it is infected with malware or a backdoor.|
|Safe|Scripts designed not to crash services.|
|Version|Scripts that extend detection capabilities.|
|Vuln|Checks for specific types of vulnerabilities.|


## Identify Exposed Services, Accounts, Permissions

* An externally facing FTP Server with Anonymous access enabled. 
* Accounts such as guest accounts, ex-employee accounts, and people who already left the company are still active. 
* Users can install software 
* Users can access shares and change permissions
* Identify Exposed Services 
  * Services can be exposed internally and externally. 
  * You must account for all your possible exposed services based on your asset and software inventory. 
  * With that knowledge, you can outline your attack surface. 
  * You can also use Nmap to scan from outside your perimeter and find out if ports or services are open or exposed.
* Identify Exposed Services Best Practices
  * Logs and Network monitoring can also indicate abnormal activity to and from the internet. 
  * Watch for unusual protocols. 
  * Check cloud storage. 
  * Restrict Peer to Peer Networking. 
  * Scan for Malware. 
  * Prevent Cryptomining. 
  * SMTP or POP traffic may mean spam is running inside your perimeter. 
  * Restrict Outbound Inbound Traffic. 
  * Take advantage of application-aware visibility from UTMs. 
  * SIEMs have add-ons and applications that help to detect malicious traffic.
* Windows and Ubuntu have Guest accounts.
  * Guest accounts are unnecessary and need to be disabled or deleted. 
  * Even if these accounts have limited access, they still represent a risk.
* Unnecessary Accounts
  * Windows Guest Accounts may give access to shares, folders, and even files. 
  * WiFi routers may allow unauthorized access
    * You can actually Google the default passwords of almost every electronic device. Just like Windows,* Ubuntu Guest Accounts will provide a level of access that can be used for exploitation and escalation of privileges. 
  * A firewall with default credentials can allow attackers to modify security settings
    * If an endpoint is compromised, attackers will probe all these devices and see if they have default credentials. 
  * Also, Ex-employee accounts left active can potentially be compromised either by external or internal actors.
* Excessive Permissions
  * Enforce SoD (Segregation of Duties), PLoP (Least of Privileges)
  * Avoid giving owner full control permissions. 
  * Reduced membership of Administrators/Root groups. 
  * Apply policies that restrict, reduce, disabled unnecessary permissions and privileges. 
  * Use RBAC to enforce and restrict privileges.
