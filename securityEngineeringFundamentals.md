# Security Engineering Fundamentals

## Introduction

### Outline main aspects

1. Security engineering is about reducing risk business operations by building security systems and processes
1. CIA triad: confidentiality - integrity - availability, which are the foundation for our information security understanding
1. Encryption and Hashing
1. Risk = Threat x Vulnerability x Impact
1. Cybersecurity aims building systems to protect against cyber attacks

**Big picture**

1. What is security engineering?
1. Why is it important? What are some common strategies?
1. What are the foundational security principles? Through them is it possible to build expertise?
1. What are the best encryptions to use? What are the best practices about them?
1. How to evaluate and prioritize risk?
1. Why is it important audit and what is its role?

## What is security engineering?

Understand functions and techniques employed by security engineer:

1. Offense vs. Defense
1. Roles and specializations
1. Big security issues
1. Other fields

**What is the difference between a security analyst and a security engineer?**

Even though the roles are similar, they are not the same.
1. Analyst:
    * responsible for utilizing tools, processes, and systems to protect an organization from threats
    * he will utilize the SIEM and action on the alerts in an effort to protect the organization from attacks. He will provide input on requirements and will help define requirements from a SIEM user perspective. He will utilize SIEM to analyze alerts and logs. Security Analysts are typically tasked with ensuring the security of an organization by utilizing security tools and processes. 
1. Engineer
    * help builds systems, processes and tools
    * SIEM is developed and deployed by engineer based on his understand of the environment to get requirements for the SIEM following requirements to select a tool. After that SIEM will be installed and deployed. And yet he will ensure data sources will be logged in the SIEM.

**What is the main difference between them?**

**While analyst utilizes the security tools and systems, engineers are tasked with building and deploying security tools and systems.**
