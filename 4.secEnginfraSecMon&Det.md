# Security Engineering Infrastructure Security

## Monitoring and Detection

### The Importance of Network Monitoring

**Network monitoring is fundamental for any infrastructure security posture**. It can be challenging **to distinguishing between what is normal, abnormal, and malicious**. Network monitoring is also part of infrastructure management. Examples: Troubleshooting network latency issues, Connectivity issues;

We will **rely on the OSI model as our nomenclature and classification framework**. 
We will **focus fundamentally on IPv4, the current leading standard for infrastructure networks**.

When you monitor **Web traffic** what layer of the OSI are you monitoring? **L7 → Application Layer**

### Fundamentals of Network Monitoring

**Network monitoring involves all 7 layers of the OSI model.**

### Hybrid Infrastructures

When companies rely on both on-prem and cloud providers for infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, and software (IAAS, PAAS, SAAS). **Hybrid infrastructures are becoming more common, blurring the perimeter**. 

There is a lot of interaction from clients and servers to outside cloud services in this type of infrastructure. It is important to consider setting a network monitoring structure at the cloud provider level. We won't focus on this network monitoring structure in this course, but you should consider it.

It's also important to think about scenarios where developers are constantly downloading and pushing code to the cloud. Think about some cloud services that allow your perimeter network to extend to the cloud seamlessly. If that is the case, the cloud is now part of your perimeter. 

Lastly, consider areas that heavily use backup and cloud storage or code repositories. If these services are misconfigured, you risk infiltration from adjacent cloud services.

### Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) Layers

**L1** - Physical Layer: In the physical layer, we find physical components such as Ethernet IEEE 802.3 and IEEE 802.11 for WiFi, or Bluetooth IEEE 802.15.1.

**L2** - Data Link: We find protocols in the data link layer that perform translation from physical components to the network, like **Address Resolution Protocol** (MAC Address to IP) or **Data Over Cable Service Interface Specification (DOCSIS,)** which allow you to connect to the internet from your cable modem.

**L3** - Network: In the network layer, we find the **Internet Protocol**, which specifies key values such as your IP address, the **Routing Information Protocol**, **a protocol used for traffic management**, and **IPSec**, **a protocol that encrypts authenticates network packets**. 

**L4** - Transport: The transport layer protocols provide **host-to-host communication services such as TCP and UDP**.

**L5** - Session: The **session layer provides mechanisms for opening, maintaining, and closing sessions between hosts**. This could be a service or an API request.

**L6** - Presentation: The **presentation layer formats and delivers network data to the application layer**. For example, **Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME)**, which you see on your email attachments (pictures, videos, documents). We also **have Secure Socket Layer and Transport Layer Security**, **both cryptographic protocols that provide security in network communications**.

**L7** - Application: You are **likely to see the application layer on your browser like a webpage via HTTP**, **transfer files via File Transfer Protocol (FTP)**, or **send emails via Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)**. 

**What is a Network Packet?** Network Packet is A unit of data that crosses a network (e.g., an Ethernet-based packet switch network). An IPv4 packet is divided into a header, a payload, and a trailer (or footer). Overview of Packet Structure for IPv4:
    * Header (14 fields) The informational fields about the packet:
        * Version: 4 for IPv4 
        * Source of the packet: IPv4 Source Address 
        * Destination: IPv4 Destination Address 
        * Protocol: 0x01 ICMP 
        * Number: For checksum purposes, displays if the packet has been split 
    * Payload: Actual data being transported 
    * Trailer: Enables the receiver to know the packet has ended and been received completely 

**Packet Flow via OSI Layers**

Let's look at an example of packets' flow for an application like File Transfer Protocol from sender to receiver.

* Sender uses an FTP client like PuTTY to enter a remote host to connect. This happens at the application level. 
* From there, **data is translated into the presentation layer using the FTP protocol**. 
* In the **session layer, a network socket is opened at the connecting source to initiate a connection towards the remote host**. 
* Next, **an end-to-end TCP connection with the remote host happens at the transport layer**. 
* Then, the **data gets formatted into IP packets at the network layer**. 
* The **data link transmits data across physical segments**. 
* Then, the packets go through the physical layer, for example, via a fiber connection. 

**After the packets flow across the physical layer, they then go through the reformatting of data in the different layers in reverse order until they reach the destination host**. In our example, **the FTP Server application, which is ultimately the receiver**. This process lasts until the sender disconnects, or the server terminates the session.

**We Rely on Packets for Detection**

We use the **OSI model and the protocols within it to monitor network traffic and detect malicious traffic**. To perform deep packet inspection, you need specific tools. Next, we will look at two of the most popular tools used to perform traffic inspection: TCPDump and Wireshark.

### Using Wireshark and Tcpdump for Packet Analysis

**The Truth is in the Packet**

We use the OSI model and the protocols within it to monitor network traffic and detect malicious traffic. Now let's take a look a two packet inspection and analysis tools, Wireshark and TCPDump.

**Wireshark**

* WireShark: Open-source packet analyzer, used for network troubleshooting and analysis. 
* Works across platforms with versions for macOS, Linux, BSD, Solaris. 
* Very similar to TCPDump, but based on a graphical user interface. 

**TShark**
* TShark: The terminal version of Wireshark 
* Can analyze on the wire and saved packet captures usually called PCAPS 

**Network Promiscuous Mode** : The ability of an Ethernet or Wi-Fi interface to inspect the full packet in its entirety. This allows for inspection of everything going through the wire or wireless (usually limited to a network segment).

**Common TShark Commands: Decode HTTP traffic on port 80 **

tshark -d tcp.port==80,http (Capture traffic into a cap )
tshark -i eth0 -w file.pcap
tshark -r file pcap (read the saved file, Here is an interesting one. Capture password on HTTP traffic)
tshark -i eth0 -Y 'http.request.method == POST and tcp contains "password"' | grep password


**TCPDump**: A packet network analyzer, allows the display of TCP/IP packets and supports Unix like Systems: Linux, macOS, FreeBSD.

Examples of TCPDump Commands:

sudo tcpdump -nni eth0 -s0 -A -v port 80 (Open traffic in port 80 using a specific interface )
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 host 192.168.4.5 (Capture traffic for the specific host IP Address from a specific interface)
sudo tcpdump -i eth0 dst 192.168.5.2 (Capture all packets going to a specific IP using a specific interface)
sudo tcpdump -s 0 -v -n -l | egrep -i "POST /|GET /|Host:" (Extract HTTP URLs from a packet capture)
sudo tcpdump -s 0 -A -n -l | egrep -i "POST /|pwd=|passwd=|password=|Host:" (Extract passwords from a post request )
sudo tcpdump -nn -v port ftp or ftp-data (Capture FTP credentials )
sudo tcpdump -nni eth0 -s0 -A -w file.pcap (Capture and write a PCAP file )

How would you capture SNMP packets in Tcpdump? Use the specific SNMP ports (tcpdump port 161 or port 162).

### Walkthrough Using Wireshark and Tcpdump for Packet Analysis

https://www.wireshark.org/download.html

Now, let’s first do some basic network discovery operations:
    1. We want first to discover the other machine. So from the Linux machine, we ping the windows machine. 
    2. Then we ping the remote host. Open Wireshark on Windows, and in the Expression field type ICMP, you should see the output similar to what is in the screenshot below with results. 

Ping and ICMP view via Wireshark
Now we can browse a remote website via our browser and see it on Wireshark. On the Linux machine, 
    • open a web browser and type in the address bar the http://IPaddress of the Windows machine. 
    • Now, in your windows machine, open Wireshark, and the expression field type tcp.port== 80 && ip.addr==themachinewhereyouareconnectingfromIPAddress. You should see the output similar to the screenshot below. 

The tcp port display filter and specific IP address
Now let’s hover over HTTP Protocol within your Wireshark interface.
    • Click on any one specific line 
    • Right-click on it 
    • Select follow HTTP Stream. 
You should see the following similar information to the screenshot below with information about that packet.

User Agents from different requests

We found some encryption-related HTTP server responses like 302 (Found), basically taking the session from a TTP request to HTTPS. You can see things such as 
    • HTTP Statutes 
    • Type of requests. Notice that the first request before going HTTPS is unencrypted. 
Next, we used TShark to visualize how dangerous clear text protocols can be. We saw an FTP server running on my Windows machine. 
    • We connected to that FTP server 
    • We saw via a command how to write a pcap with tshark. 
    • We opened it with Wireshark and found the credential exchange in the packets. 
    • In the Windows machine, we typedtshark.exe -d tcp.port==21,ftpftp -w ftp.pcap 
    • This is a filter for FTP protocol so we can see the entire exchange. 
    • The output looked like the screenshot below.

Filter capture to display port 21 and FTP protocol
NOTE: If you are logged in as the user student you will need to provide a full path of the file that is being saved. 
Depending on your setup you may need to find the right interface for TSHARK to listen to and write the pcap file. Here are the steps to troubleshoot:
    1. If you are logged in as a user, the way to find out is by opening a terminal in windows and typing whoami. 

Type whoami
    2. We will need also to place ourselves within tshark directory by doing the following. 
Place yourself in the tshark directory
    3. Now let’s determine our ethernet interface by typing the following command as displayed in the image below.
Determine the ethernet interface
    4. Finally, let’s execute tshark -i4 (as you can see above is the number for the Ethernet interface) -d tcp.port==21,ftp -w c:\Users:\student\Desktop\ftp.pcap. The reason we are providing the full path for the ftp.pcap file is that we want to save it on the Desktop so it is easier to access and not within the Wireshark folder and avoid permission errors.
Execute tshark -i4 -d tcp.port==21,ftp -w c:\Users:\student\Desktop\ftp.pcap
    5. Now, in your ubuntu machine open a terminal type ftp 10.0.2.4 (windows ip address) it may be different in your settings and type a couple of random usernames and passwords. 
Ubuntu Machine Terminal
    6. Finally, in your Windows 10 VM open Wireshark and open the ftp.pcap file. You can type FTP on the filter bar to see only FTP packets as given in the following screenshot. 
ftp.pcap
    7. Now open the packet and see the clear text credentials that are being sent via FTP. 
Packet 6 ftp.pcap
Packet 9 ftp.pcap
Then we wrote to a PCAP and then found it.
tshark.exe -d tcp.port==21, ftp -w ftp.pcap
Capturing on 'Ethernet'
173
Next, we found the file.pcap file. 
    • On the FTP protocol, we right-clicked 
    • Then selected follow TCP Stream 
We saw an output showing the passwords and user names in plain text shown in the screenshot below.

Plain text credentials in FTP Packets
Now you should better understand why having clear text protocols inside your perimeter is a huge risk. Also, remember there are display filters and capture filters in Wireshark. 
I do not recommend using a capture filter, which will only capture the specific protocol or filter unless you are sure that is what you want. You can often see contextual information around specific connections, but if you reduce your capture, you may not see it.

sudo tcpdump -ni enp0s3 -s0 -A icmp

### Implement Best Practices for Windows Event Logs

**Microsoft Windows Logs**

* Can be configured to log particular events. 
* Every system must be configured either locally or via GPO. 
* We can log events from application, system, security, setup, forwarded events. 

**Audit Logging for Windows Machines and Ubuntu Machines**

* System: Events related to specific windows system events. 
* Application: Application events at the machine, for example, Microsoft Internet Information Server. 
* Security: Audited events, login events, elevated events. 
* Setup: Operating system installation and updates. 
* Forwarded Events: Events sent to the machine from other machines if set as a collector.

**Microsoft Windows Logs **
*Severity Level*
* Information: An event has occurred. 
* Warning: An event that may indicate a problem. 
* Error: A problem or failure. 
* Critical: A severe failure or problem has occurred. 
* Audit Success: A security audit condition logged. 
* Audit Failure: A security audit condition logged. 

*Audit Logging of Windows Events*
* You must enable auditing to get the most of Windows logs. 
* The best way to enable logs is via Group Policy Objects. 

*Enable Audit Logging of Windows Events *
* Log Auditing can ben enabled centrally or locally
    * At Domain Controller 
    * At Workstation 

*Auditing logs need management*
* Local & Central Storage. 
* Retention. How long you keep them. 
* Rotation. This usually means how, as the age of the log increases, they are moved to other locations. 

*Steps To Enable Log Auditing*
* Right-click on the windows start menu and select run 
* type gpedit.msc to open the local group policy editor 
* Go to Local Computer Policy ->Computer Configuration ->Windows Settings ->Security 

Settings->Local Policies->Audit Policy 

|Policy|Security Setting|
|------|----------------|
|Audit Account logon events|Success, Failure|
|Audit Account management|Success, Failure|
|Audit Directory service access|Success, Failure|
|Audit logon events|Success, Failure|
|Audit object access|Success, Failure|
|Audit policy change|Success, Failure|
|Audit privilege use|Success, Failure|
|Audit process tracking|Success, Failure|
|Audit system events|Success, Failure|

If you enable logon events, you want to know if the user account successfully logged in (success) or was denied (failure). **If you do not enable failure, you won't see this in your logs**.

Another important example is privileged use. **You definitely want to know if someone tries to run as an administrator and if someone with an account was successful or not.**

**Remember to Execute gpupdate in your terminal to apply policies.**

**Event IDs you should know by heart**
* 4624: logon event 
* 4625: failed logon event 
* 4688: new process created 
* 4740: account lockout 
* 4648: attempt to logon with explicit credentials 
* 5025: windows firewall service has stopped 
* 1102: log was cleared 
* 4767: user account was unlocked 
* 4657: registry value was changed 
* 4616: system time was changed 
* 4719: system audit policy was changed 
* 4825. A user was denied access via Remote Desktop.

The main logs that need to be monitored to analyze log on patterns of users are EventID 4624 and 4625. 4624 is logon.

The main logs that need to be monitored to analyze log on patterns of users are EventID 4624 and 4625. 4625 is logoff.

### Implement Windows Sysmon And Linux Syslog

**Windows Sysmon** https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/sysmon

* Windows Sysmon: A Microsoft Window system service to monitor system activity and provide Windows Logs 
* Remains running at reboots. 
* Provides more detailed information about process creation, network connections, changes to file creation time than standard windows events. 
* Provides a means of detecting anomalies and potentially malicious activity. 
* These logs provide the baseline for centralized security monitoring of endpoints. 

#### Windows Sysmon Event Breakdown

* Event ID 1: Process creation.
    * Newly created process. 
    * Full command line. 
    * Hash of file. 
    * Time Stamps in UTC. 
    * Very important when tracking suspicious new processes or exploitation at the endpoint. 
* Event ID 2: Process changed file creation time
    * Tracks real-time creation of a file. 
* Event ID 3: Network connection.
    * Very important event when tracking possible command control communications. 
* Event ID 4: Sysmon service state changed. 
* Event ID 5: Process terminated.
    * UTC Time. 
    * Process GUID. 
    * ProcessId. 
* Event ID 6: Driver loaded. 
* Event ID 7: Image Loaded. 
* Event ID 8: CreateRemoteThread. 
* Event ID 9: RawAccessRead
    * Reading operations from the drive using .\ denotation. 
* Event ID 10: Process Access
    * Reports when a process opens another process. 
* Event ID 11: FileCreate
    * File create operations when a file is created or overwritten. 
* Event ID 12: RegistryEvent (Object create and delete). Registry key create & delete operations. 
* Event ID 13: RegistryEvent (Value Set). Records value written for Registry values DWORD and QWORD. 
* Event ID 14: RegistryEvent (Key & Value Rename). Registry key and value rename operations.
    * All these events are very valuable for forensics and investigation due to the nature that they collect. 
* Event ID 16: ServiceConfigurationChange. 
* Event ID 17: PipeEvent (Pipe Created). 
* Event ID 18: PipeEvent (Pipe Connected). 
* Event ID 19: WmiEvent (WmiEventFiler activity detected). 
* Event ID 20: WmiEvent (WmiEventconsumer activity detected). 
* Event ID 21: WmiEvent (WmiEventConsumerToFiler activity detected). 
* Event ID 22: DNSEvent (DNS query). A process executing a DNS query. 
* Event ID 23: FileDelete (A file delete was detected). 
* Event ID 255: Error 

sysmon.exe -i -n --accepteula
Default events include
    • Process Create (Event ID 1) 
    • The driver loaded (Event ID 6) 
    • Process terminated (Event ID 5) 
    • File creation time changed (Event ID 2) 
    • RawAccessRead (Event ID 9) 
    • CreateRemoteThread (Event ID 8) 
    • Sysmon service state change (Event ID 4) 
    • Network connection (Event ID 3) 
sysmon --accepteula -i C:\sysmon_customconfig.xml

### Structure of Syslog

* Header
    * Priority
    * Version
    * Timestamp
    * Hostname
    * Application
    * Process id
    * Message id
* Structure-data
    * key value in brackets {key:value}
* Message
    * Job 'cron.daily' terminated

* Linux Syslog
    * The standard for message logging on a supported OS. 
    * Supported by Linux, Unix, and macOS. 
    * Allows network devices to send messages and log events. 


|Value|Severity|Keyword|Description|
|-----|--------|-------|-----------|
|0|Emergency|emerg|System is unstable|
|1|Alert|alert|Should be corrected immediately|
|2|Critical|crit|Critical Conditions|
|3|Error|err|Error Conditions|
|4|Warning|warning|May indicate an error if action is not taken|
|5|Notice|notice|Unusual events without error conditions|
|6|Informational|info|Normal operational messages, no action required|
|7|Debug|debug|Information Useful for debugging applications|


**Location of these logs are usually at /var/log/syslog**

If you wanted to find information about a ransomware payload executed against a host on your network what are the two Sysmon events that you would use for this purpose. We want to know malicious process creation (Sysmon 1) and we want to see if this process changes file creation time (Sysmon 2) which is one of the first things ransomware payloads do.

#### Implement Syslog And Linux Auditing

1. In your Ubuntu machine
CIS 4.1.1.1 
The capturing of system events provides system administrators with information to determine if unauthorized access to their system occurs.
dpkg -s auditd audispd-plugins 

CIS 4.1.1.2
The capturing of system events provides system administrators with information to determine if unauthorized access to their system occurs.
systemctl is-enabled auditd 

CIS 4.1.3
Unexpected changes in system date and/or time could be a sign of malicious activity on the system.
grep time-change /etc/audit/rules.d/*.rules 

CIS 4.1.4
Unexpected changes to these files could indicate that the system has been compromised and that an unauthorized user is attempting to hide their activities or compromise additional accounts.
grep identity /etc/audit/rules.d/*.rules

2. In your Windows machine

CIS 2.2.3 
The Act as part of the operating system user right is extremely powerful. Anyone with this user right can take complete control of the computer and erase evidence of their activities.
Audit:
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Polices\User Rights Assignment\Act as part of the operating system

CIS 2.2.5 
Any account with the Allow log on locally user right can log on at the computer's console. If you do not restrict this user right to legitimate users who need to log on to the console of the computer, unauthorized users could download and run malicious software to elevate their privileges.
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Polices\User Rights Assignment\Allow log on locally

CIS 2.2.15 
The Debug programs user rights can be exploited to capture sensitive computer information from system memory or access and modify kernel or application structures. 
Some attack tools exploit this user's right to extract hashed passwords and other private security information or insert rootkit code. By default, the Debug programs user right is assigned only to administrators, which helps mitigate the risk from this vulnerability.
Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Local Polices\User Rights Assignment\Debug Programs

#### Importance of Endpoint Security and Monitoring

Endpoint security: **A security approach that focuses on protecting end-user devices connected inside the perimeter**. **This would include laptops, desktops, and mobile devices**. Endpoint focuses on several components. Some products may have all these components. Some others may only have some. 
These components include: 
    • Machine Learning 
    • Antivirus 
    • Disk Encryption 
    • Application Whitelisting 
    • Privileged User Control 
    • Integrated Firewalls 
Sometimes the central management can be inside the perimeter or can be hosted in the cloud.

Endpoint Security Benefits 
    • Increase visibility - Endpoint products have deep access and reach within clients. 
    • Unified security features in a single suite. An easier way to deploy multiple protection features. 
    • Easier to manage. Centralized or Cloud-based management. 
    • Ability to apply proactive measures. 


Packet monitoring and analysis is a task usually performed by specific security analysts. Analyzing traffic requires TCP/IP knowledge and technical ability to understand packet data. It takes time to get to a point where you are comfortable looking at packets, even in a nice GUI like Wireshark. 

However, I encourage you to do it from time to time within your perimeter. I have found that services may allow entry into the perimeter, like remote support tools may be installed for a long time even if you don’t use them anymore.

This is especially true of remote access tools such as VNC or even applications that have VNC as part of their stack. These tools need to be monitored, as they may provide access to external malicious actors and potential internal rogue insiders.

### SIEM

Security Information and Event Management Software Platform
* Aggregates logs and indexes them and performs analytics 
* Collects security logs from network devices, servers, desktops, laptops, firewalls, access points, etc. 
* Some new technologies apply Machine Learning analytics 
* Other new technologies include Security Orchestration Automation and Response 

**Best Practices SIEM**

* Do not log everything. 
* Focus your monitoring, do not overwhelm yourself with alerts. 
* Plan for expansion and manage growth. The licensing cost will increase as you add more log sources. 
* Control & Manage access to SIEM. 
* Evaluate your data sources and alert effectiveness. 


Blue teaming and Adversarial Simulation
A Blue Team is a group of individuals who are tasked with identifying security flaws, hardening systems, and in general, defending the enterprise against malicious actors. Blue Team operators have to constantly monitor, detect, and defend against old, present, and future threats. Basically, it's similar to what you are learning in this course.
There are new tools that help the Blue Teamer probe and tests the efficiency of their procedures and response capacity. These new tools allow the team to replicate attacks in specific scenarios and execute specific tactics and procedures. 
So, for example, you can execute technique T1003, which is a credential access technique, and then find out via SIEM if this was detected or not. The advantage of these tools is that now Blue Teams can perform attacks that either had to be done by pentesters or someone with an offensive background to test their security measures. 
Remember you if you perform adversarial simulations, make sure that you use Golden Images. If you do not perform adversarial simulation against a corporate golden image, you really have not measured your organization's resilience. Also, remember Adversarial Simulation does not replace a penetration test, vulnerability assessment, or bug bounty.
