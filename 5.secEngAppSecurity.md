# Security Engineer Application Security

## Introduction

1. Common web application vulnerabilities
   1. identify a vulnerability base on the OWASP-10
   2. recommend best practices to remediate the vulnerability
2. web penetration testing
   1. navigate through and do manual reconnaissance on the site to determine areas of focus
   2. simulate different attack vectors like SQLi, XXS, Broken Authentication, and Broken Access.
   3. use and understand how to brute force login
   4. identify hashes, encoding, and perform hash lookups.
3. discovery methodologies
   1. read static scan reports and identify the vulnerabilities
   2. prioritize the vulnerabilities based on severity
   3. recommend high level best practices on how to fix the vulnerabilities
4. vulnerability response
   1. perform a write up on all validation to show all steps to reproduce
   2. use the OWASP top 10 to properly determine the severity of vulnerabilities
5. mitigation and verification
   1. work with both dev and QA team to help improve communications and security posture
   2. retest code fixes to ensure they are secure and didn't create any new vulnerabilities

## Common Web Application Vulnerabilities

Why do we need Application Security? 
Application Security is no different than any other field within IT, which is primary focus to make sure that not only is everything configured and working as expected, but that they are also doing it in a way that is secure.

Can't we just use a Web Application Firewall (WAF)? 
Web application firewalls (WAF) are **a basic first line of defense for online traffic** and are **great tools that all businesses should consider as a layer of security**, but before you can use a WAF, you have to make **sure you not only configure it properly but also take the time to ensure it is properly trained for your application**. **WAF can be bypassed or tricked**, which is the reason why most **security experts see them as a part of a security plan that has multiple layers to it vs. it being the only security item used to protect your web application**.

Aren't Frameworks supposed to be secure?
Application frameworks are a great addition to any programming language as they add a great collection of tools and capability for developers and security team to use out of the box.

## OWASP Top 10

Open Web Application Security Project and is an **international non-profit organization focused on web application security**.

### Injection

Injection flaws, such as SQL, NoSQL, OS, and LDAP injection, occur when **untrusted data is sent to an interpreter as part of a command or query**. The attacker’s hostile data **can trick the interpreter into executing unintended commands or accessing data without proper authorization**.

username: fake
password: fake' or 1='1

SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'fake' AND password='fake' or 1='1';
SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = 'fake' AND password='fake' OR 1='1';
SELECT * FROM users WHERE FALSE             AND FALSE           OR TRUE;
SELECT * FROM users WHERE FALSE             OR TRUE;
SELECT * FROM users WHERE TRUE;

return all lines from users table.


**Best Practice**

* **use parameterized queries**, which is the best method because all variables are limited to the data type. This will prevent malicious code from breaking out of the SQL code and preventing the malicious code from running.
* sanitize all input, which means preventing malicious code from running not only in SQL Queries but also in other parts of your code

### Broken Authentication

Application functions related to authentication and session management are **often implemented incorrectly**, **allowing attackers to** compromise passwords, keys, or session tokens, or to exploit other implementation flaws to assume other users’ identities temporarily or permanently.

Some methods for broken authentication

* **credential stuffing**: most commonly used technique, since the amount of breach data that is exposed on the open/dark web attackers. The attackers can use those credentials to try and gain access to users' account **if that user has the same password across multiple system**. (https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Credential_stuffing)
* **brute force**: this technique is slowly dying off as more and more applications require secondary information like multi-factor authentication (MFA). The attacker uses common/harvest username and common passwords against a web application in hopes of finding an account that is using a combination from the list.
* **default passwords**: this is when an application has default credentials that are used for the initial setup of the application, but the end-user hasn't updated the information with new and strong passwords.
* **exposed Session ID in the URL**: is when the actual Session ID is embedded inside the URL for the web application. Through exposing the Session ID in the URL, it can end up in various places like Proxy Logs, Server Logs, and Browser History.

**best practice**
* **MFA**: it is one of the best methods for protecting accounts, even if a user credentials are exposed to the internet either by data breaches or stolen using some type of exploit, the user account is still safe because the attacker will not be able to login without the MFA.
* **captcha**: a captcha is a good way to slow down or even stop attackers from using some sort of automation on your web application
* **failed login attempts**: By using failed login attempts, you can auto-lock accounts or even block the IP address that appears to be using brute force against a user account

### Sensitive Data Exposure

Many web applications and APIs **do not properly protect sensitive data**, such as financial, healthcare, and PII. Attackers may **steal or modify such weakly protected data** to conduct credit card fraud, identity theft, or other crimes. Sensitive data may be compromised without extra protection, such as **encryption at rest or in transit, and requires special precautions when exchanged with the browser**.

**Best Practice**
* **Check code using Sensitive Data**: **all code that is using any sensitive data is working as expected and properly secure**
* **Strong Hashing**: strong adaptive and salted hashing functions with a delay factor for passwords
* **Limit storing sensitive data to only what is needed**: more sensitive data stored, higher the risk put on web application, by limiting the data to only the data needed you can reduce your risk.
* **Encrypt all data in transit and at rest**: encrypted in transit by **using HTTPS with strong cipher and that all stored data is encrypted on rest**.
