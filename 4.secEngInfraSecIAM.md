# Security Engineering Infrastructure Security

## Identity Access Management

### Overview

IAM provides the ability to:
* match right user with the right access
* enforce security policies
* apply principles of least privilege
* apply principles of separation of duties
* verify the identity of access requests

IAM has the following pillars:
* identification: who you are (for instance, username)
* authentication: prove who you are (for instance, password)
* authorization: the process of proving who you are

IAM is the foundation of
* the creation of users
* application of access controls (RBAC, DAC, MAC)
* application of identification, authentication, authorization methods such as SSo, MFA

### Principle of least privilege

PoLP has a basic concept that is a user or process has enough privileges to perform its functions. PoLP demands a perimeter of action for each user, or group, which means proper privileges.

**For instance**: a user can log in and operate a program. However, the user does not have the right to modify or install any program.

**Benefits of Principle of Least Privilege**

* **Restricts users, processes, or applications to only specific privileges**
* Prevents users, processes, and applications **from potentially taking over the operating system** 
* **Attack surface is reduced**, in the case a user or applications are compromised, **damage is limited**

**Best Practices for PoLP**

* Track individual rights 
* **Monitor escalation of privileges**
* **Audit account privilege regularly** 
* Apply to PoLP across users, processes, and applications 

**The main goal is to make sure every entity only has enough privileges to do its job.**

### Segregation of duties

It is a technique that requires with a check-in place more than one person authentication and authorization to complete a task.

For instance:

* a dev commits code and creates a pull request
* a second dev checks code, approves pr, and merges codes
* quality assurance manager tests code in CI/CD platform
* code's new version is released

A priori, just one dev cannot publish a new release independently. So reflect: **why do you think this could be beneficial security-wise?**

**Segregation of Duties Best Practices**

* it need a policy and defined access controls to enforce it.
  * policies must be suitable for your organization
* creating clear workflows for approvals access requests, that are under policies
* monitoring and tracking provisioned privileges. Do not allow accounts to accumulate privileges and cross access boundaries.
* access control such as RBAC can help apply SoD. They are usually implemented via a central authority to provide access depending on a specific role
* use service accounts for specific purposes
  
### service accounts

* Apply PoLP And SoD 
* A non-human account created for a specific service or task 
* Consider service accounts when trying to apply PoLP and SoD.
  
### Access Control Models

* **Mandatory Access Control**
  * access is based on an object and a subject
  * when a subject tries to access an object, security attributes determine the level of access
    * for instance, user wants to access a file, and this user may have only a specific type of access that they cannot change as this comes from a central authority.
* **Discretionary Access Control**
  * access restrictions based on the identity of subjects or groups to which they belong.
  * this access model implies permissions can be inherited or passed to an individual user by others
  * organization groups determine access per group membership. You can see every one in the payroll group has READ permission, but they do not have access to the sales group in the sales group.
* **Role-based Access Control**
  * access based on specific roles
  * can implement MAC or DAC access control models
  * recommended for enterprises with 500 users or more
  * policy neutral. RBAC is designed around roles and privileges

**Three Rules in RBAC**
* a role has to be assigned to a user, and this alone allows him to exercise permissions
* authorization for that role has to be active and defined
* exercise of permission is subjected to authorization from the granted role

**RBAC Considerations**
* permissions can be assigned to many roles and operations
* a single operation can be assigned to many permissions
* roles can have many subjects, and a subject can have many roles
* roles can have many permissions

### Audit Access and Permissions

WIth auditing, we can see how roles, permissions, and operations work with users.
In Linux: auditd (https://linux.die.net/man/8/auditd)
In Windows: audits with GPOs

#### Linux Ubuntu Auditd

* set of rules loaded in the kernel audit system 
* More information: http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/xenial/man8/auditd.8.html 
* Based on Auditd Daemon

Looks for configuration files at:
* /etc/audit/audit.rules 
* /etc/audit/auditd.conf

Auditd - Audit.Rules

* Installation
  * sudo apt install auditd
  * sudo service auditd start
  * sudo service auditd status
  * systemctl is-enabled auditd
* to list current rules
  * sudo auditctl -l
* Audit results are found in
  * /var/log/audit/audit.log
* file system rules
  * w: specifies the directory to watch
  * p: specifies the permissions to be logged
  * k: is for optional strings to identify rules

For instance: watch /etc/sudoers directory and log wa permissions to look for changes in sudoers
* auditctl -w /etc/sudoers -p wa -k change_in_sudoers
* then verify: auditctl -l

* system call rule
  * system call rules are for activities beyond the application level
  * auditctl -a action,list -S syscall -F field=value -k keyname
* control rule
  * audit configuration changes in the auditd system itself
  * sudo auditctl -s

### Best practices between service to service communication

* Any unencrypted communication presents risks
* even inside perimeter, communications must be protected by encryption
* take a look at industry and government compliance standards. They may required specific levels of encryption
* consider encryption in every aspect of your security posture

### encryption inside the perimeter

#### data at rest

* data is stored (db, file system)
* servers, desktops, laptops, even mobiles

#### data at transit

* data transmitted

#### data in use
* encrypt data in memory
* even though this type of data has a high payload, and encryption is difficult to achieve.

#### email encryption

* tls tunnels to other offices
* IPSec inside the perimeter
* VPN

### IPSec or Internet Protocol Security

* Encrypts TCP packets end to end
* Encryption compatible ciphers: AES, 3DES, DES
* Authentication algorithms: HMC-MD5, HMC-SHA1,2
* Key exchange algorithms: IKE, DH KEA
* It is applies for a host to host and network to network
* It works at L3
* It can be used both Windows either Linux based networks
* Digital certificates can be implemented for authentication
* IPSec performs mutual party authentication via cryptographic key exchanges

#### IPSec protocols

* authentication of header, integrity, and verification of packets
* encapsulating security protocol (ESP)
* encrypts packet IP Header & Payload
* protocols involved in the encryption process and key exchange like internet key exchange protocol

#### IPSec Comm Exchange Example

1. P1 exchanges cryptography keys with P2
2. At L3 level, or transport layer, verification of the exchange happens via packet headers and trailers, in which are the authentication information and packet verification
3. Following identification and verification, authentication takes place
4. Then, packet payload is encrypted
   1. Depending on the IPSec mode it'll encrypted header and payload (tunnel) or only the payload (transport)
5. Encrypted data is transmitted via L3 using UDP protocol
6. Decryption occurs at the end of the process, when P2 is viewing data

Considerations:

* Performance issues my occur due to IPSec processing loads, which means IPSec is process intensive due to the constant encrypt and decrypt.
* Things that are not sensible do not need to go through IPSec
* Always take care of keys and certifications

### Best Practices for Perimeter Encryption 

* Do not use weak encryption standards
* Mange and protect your encryption keys and digital certificates
* Take care: encryption everything increases system load and decreases performance
* Probably, high encryption environment may break legacy applications and services

### Key and certificate management

Always take care: implementing service to service communication encryption implies managing and protecting cryptographic keys and digital certificates either generated internally or purchased by a third party.

#### Cryptographic keys
* a string of data used to unlock cryptographic functions
  * authentication
  * authorization
  * encryption
* It is important know where they are, who has them, and when they need to be rotated
* They must be protected and managed
* If your keys are compromised, you must revoke your keys and reissue them.

#### Digital certificates
* as electronic document that proves ownership of a public cryptographic key
* includes information about the key
  * owner
  * signature that verifies is authenticity
* a certificate authority usually issues certificates
* certificates are used to sign and authenticate encrypted communications

#### Public key infrastructure

* registration authority verifies requests for issuing a certificate to an entity
* certificate store is database that stores digital certificates
* certificate revocation list lists digital certificates that have been revoked and that serves as a reference
* certificate authority issues the certificate and the validity
  * create policies that dictates the role's duties of PKI infrastructure
* entities issued certificates
  * signed documents, smart card logons, SSL/TLS authentication, encryption of email communication

#### Best Practices For Key Management 

* Protect your encryption key management system, **including physically**
* Access must be audited
* Keys must be rotated
* Create an air gap backup, which means somewhere **off-site and not** connected to the internet
  * Then, encrypt where you store them
* Create **recovery keys in case of system failure or compromise**
* Manage issue and revocation
  * revoking them early may become a burden and cost money
  * work to find the proper length of time for a certificate
* Be ready to replace or revoke them if needed
* Self-signed is easy, but risk
  * it is better than having no certificates at all, but eventually they will have to be replaced or managed correctly
* Use a 3rd party because create a PKI may be too expensive
* Store them separated from the key. This is a way to avoid a single point of failure

### Credential Management

CIS benchmarks

* password length: 14 characters or more
* password composition: at least 1 non-alphabetic character, a number and an uppercase character
* password expiration: 1-year expiration
* password banning: top 20 more common or bad passwords
* session lock idle time: 15 minutes
* monitor failed logins
  * microsoft recommends lockout after 10 failed authentication events
* suspend accounts not in use
  * automatically suspend after 4 days of inactivity.
* No password hints should be supplied

#### Passwords, a Favorite Target for Malicious Actors

* credential stuffing: credentials obtained from breaches are probed against multiple sites
* phishing: emails, sms, cloned sites with malicious code capture passwords
* keystroke logging: malware logs keystrokes can capture passwords
* local discovery: passwords on stickers or spreadsheets with passwords
* brute force: Using a dictionary of users and passwords to gain access via multiple tries

#### Single Sign-On

* All credentials have a life cycle and need to have an expiration or renewal date. 
* Enforce long, complex password policies. 
* Prevent embedding hard coding credentials in code or applications. 
* Implement SSO & MFA if possible. 

### Audit Password Policy

Having password alone is a fragile form of authentication.
Having policies in place does not mean they will be followed.
You must enforce and audit it.
The best approach is to apply multi-factor authentication (MFA)

#### where passwords files stored?

Windows:

security account manager file: C:\Windows\System32\Config\SAM

Linux Files:

/etc/passwd -user account
/etc/shadow  -password information
/etc/group -user group information

#### hashing a password

A one-way transformation of a password into a string
  * which means irreversible, at least in concept
* NTLM Hashes
  * AES Encryption AES-128-CBC. Advanced encryption standard with a 128-bit key
  * Combination of AES\DES for hashing
* SHA-512, linux hashing passwords

#### Tools for Auditing Passwords 

* Match hashes to passwords 
* Use a Dictionary of known passwords 
* Break weak cryptographic algorithms 

* Windows
  * Mimikatz  https://github.com/gentilkiwi/mimikatz
  * L0pth Crack 
  * Cain & Abel 
  * John The Ripper https://www.openwall.com/john/
* Linux
  * John The Ripper 
  * Hashcat https://hashcat.net/hashcat/

#### Best Practices for Password Auditing 

* establish a plan every 3 or 6 months
* audit all accounts, including **service accounts**
* check against well-known password leaked
  * the biggest list is RockYou
  * Create your own with a combination of all these files and make sure your passwords do not match them
* Create a schema for account naming and creation
* Specific nomenclature for Servers, Desktops & Mobiles
* Specific nomenclature for Users vs. Administrators and Service Accounts or Special Groups
* Have policies and mechanisms ready in case of a breach
* Use GPOs to enforce password change
* Have Cloud Platform Mechanisms in place to enforce password change
* Have a plan to reset and reissue other credentials as well

### Multi-factor authentication

When is used more the one way of authentication, beyond usernames/passwords

Three scopes
* something you know
  * passwords
  * code, PIN
  * word or phrase
* something you have
  * cellphone to receive a text after you enter your password
  * usb key to insert after you authenticate
  * application like Microsoft Authentication or Google Authentication
* something you are
  * eye's retina
  * fingerprint
  * face
  * voice

* All MFA activities need to be log and monitored
* May need to remote wipe in some cases
* Make sure you can revoke user's rights and access if an employee leaves the organization
* Be ready to remove the device
* Provide alternative methods
* make it as user friendly as possible and compatible

#### MFA Can Be Defeated

* brute force
* phishing
* man in the middle
* sim swap
* endpoint or mobile compromise

#### Best Practices In Multi-Factor Authentication 

* Combine different authentication factors per use case 
* Retina scan for security operation center access 
* USB Key for changing account information at HR Portal 
* Watch lockouts
* Use apps like Microsoft Authenticator for email and cloud applications
* Chose publicly available methods against proprietary
* Hardware tokens increase support with potential loss or breakage
* It is a mistake to base your MFA strategy on one single factor

### Password Auditing Walkthrough

* Linux
  * sudo unshadow /etc/passwd /etc/shadow > password.txt
    * This allowed us to see the passwords in this file in plain text
  * john password.txt
* Windows
  * downloaded John The Ripper and Password Dump 7 for Windows
  * Run Password dump in an Elevated Terminal
    * runas /user:win10-student\administrator cmd.exe
    * PwDump7.exe > passwords.txt
    * .john.exe C:\Users\student\Desktop\pwdump\passwords.txt


### Disconnect a user that was apparently caught accessing in an unauthorized manner

* who
* netstat
* sudo netstat -tulpan |grep ESTABLISHED
  * The above will give you only ESTABLISHED sessions via the network.
* ps -aux|grep sshd
* pgrep -u ustudent sshd
* kill -9 PID
